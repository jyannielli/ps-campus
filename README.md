# Campus Map - Princeton and Slavery Project

Instructions for location descriptions:

content/descriptions/location_name.txt

This text is processed as markdown, the same format GitHub uses for its repo readme files.
Single new lines will be ignored, and won't cause a paragraph change.

Two or more new lines will be read as a new paragraph. All standard markdown style rules also apply.
*Single stars around a group of text* mean italics. **Double stars** mean bold.

Obviously not all features will be useful for this site:
* Using markdown is meant to facilitate basic text formatting and customization.
* Lists could possibly be useful.
* Things like block quotes and more advanced features probably shouldn't be used.

You can also write links and format them in a nice way.
I can link to [Google](https://www.google.com) or [Kapricorn Media](http://www.kapricornmedia.com).

[GitHub's markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
